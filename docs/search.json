    "text": "Hi\nHello! I’m Seowoo Park, a master’s student in the GIS Lab at Seoul National University. I’m very interested in spatial data science and am studying how to make better use of data. This semester, I’ve started to dive into machine learning and deep learning. It’s… not easy, to be honest. Still, I’m taking it one day at a time, hoping to become a better scholar tomorrow—and the day after—than I am today.\nI plan to use this website to give a brief introduction to who I am and to share what I’m learning and bits of everyday life. Welcome!"
